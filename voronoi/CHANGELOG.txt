CHANGELOG:
vmath.inl:
  * renamed to vmath.cpp
vmath.cpp: 
  * line1 added: #include "vmath.h", because couldn't find all the definitions.
vmath.h:
  * line 36 deleted. #include "vmath.cpp" was wrong, because .h included .cpp.
VEdge.h:
  * line 4 changed from "Vpoint.h" to "VPoint.h" because in GNU systems, upper and lower case name files are different.
Voronoi.cpp: 
  * added #include <cmath>

  
  
main_old.cpp: deleted
NVoronoi.vcxproj deleted
NVoronoi.vcxproj.filters deleted
NVoronoi.vcxproj.users deleted


To compile under GNU/Linux with g++:
g++ *.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o voronoi.bin

Then run: ./voronoi.bin
